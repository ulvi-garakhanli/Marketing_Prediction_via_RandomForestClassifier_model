Marketing_Prediction_via_RandomForestClassifier_model. In this project, we built a Random Forest Classifier model on Bank 'marketing' data. In first file, we finished the pre-processing and use Woe transformation then we built base_model and after that, we search best_params. Then optimized our model and get a high Gini coefficient (52%), hence we deployed our trained model on new 'marketing_test' data and get the prediction.In second file, after pre-processing we use Dumies method then built base_model and optimized model and get a high Gini coefficient (56%), hence we deployed our trained model on new 'marketing_test' data and get the prediction.
